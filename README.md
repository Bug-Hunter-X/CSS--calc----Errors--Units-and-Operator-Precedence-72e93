This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors related to the CSS `calc()` function. The `bug.css` file shows examples of incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.css` provides corrected versions.  The first error is caused by omitting units in the calculation. The second error arises from incorrect nesting or operator precedence within the `calc()` function. Each error and its solution are clearly commented in the CSS files.
