The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be issues if you're using it with units incorrectly. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` is correct but `width: calc(100% - 10)` is not, as it lacks the `px` or other units for the 10.  Another less common error is incorrect nesting or operator precedence within the `calc()` function, especially if dealing with multiple calculations. You might have forgotten parentheses or incorrectly ordered operations.
